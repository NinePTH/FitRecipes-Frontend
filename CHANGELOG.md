#### Fixed
- **CI/CD Compatibility Issues**
  - Replaced rolldown-vite with standard Vite v6 for better CI stability
  - Fixed native binding errors in GitHub Actions
  - Resolved npm dependency installation issues

- **Code Quality Issues**

- **Testing Setup**
  - Fixed Router conflict in App.test.tsx (removed duplicate BrowserRouter wrapper)

#### Technical Decisions
- **Standard Vite over Rolldown**: Chose stability and CI compatibility over cutting-edge performance

- **Tailwind v3**: Using stable version instead of v4 for better plugin compatibility
- **Placeholder Implementation**: All features have UI and structure but await backend integration
